# Legal Reasoning Model

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed for legal reasoning tasks. The model is trained to understand, analyze, and reason about legal documents, case law, and statutes, providing assistance in legal research, document analysis, and case prediction.

## Key Features
- Natural language understanding of legal texts
- Case outcome prediction based on facts and precedents
- Legal document classification and summarization
- Statute and regulation interpretation
- Legal argument generation and evaluation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- AWS account with SageMaker access
- IAM permissions for S3, SageMaker, and ECR
- AWS CLI configured

## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-reason-model.git
cd legal-reason-model

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Data Preparation
Follow the detailed instructions in [data-preparation.md](data-preparation.md) to:
- Format your legal corpus
- Create training, validation, and test splits
- Upload data to Amazon S3

### 3. Model Training
Follow the detailed instructions in [implementation.md](implementation.md) to:
- Configure the model architecture
- Set up SageMaker training jobs
- Monitor training progress
- Evaluate model performance

### 4. Inference
```python
from src.model import LegalReasoningModel

model = LegalReasoningModel.load_from_path("models/legal_reasoning_v1.0")
prediction = model.predict("What is the legal precedent for this case?")
print(prediction)
```
