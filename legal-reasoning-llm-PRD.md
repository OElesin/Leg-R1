# Leg-R1: A Large Language Model for Legal Reasoning

## Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

Leg-R1 is a specialized large language model designed for legal reasoning with a lightweight parameter scale of 7 billion. This model addresses three critical pain points in the legal industry:

- **Fragmented legal knowledge** integration across jurisdictions and practice areas
- **Uncontrollable reasoning logic** in legal applications requiring transparent decision-making
- **Weak domain generalization ability** across different legal systems and specialties

Building on the successful architecture and methodology of Fin-R1, Leg-R1 will employ a two-stage framework combining data distillation and reinforcement learning to create a powerful yet efficient legal reasoning assistant.

## 2. Problem Statement

Legal professionals face significant challenges when using general-purpose LLMs for specialized legal tasks:

1. **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Legal information is scattered across statutes, case law, regulations, and jurisdictional variations, making comprehensive understanding difficult.

2. **Reasoning Transparency**: Legal applications require traceable, step-by-step reasoning that adheres to legal principles and can withstand scrutiny in court.

3. **Cross-Domain Applicability**: Legal practitioners need models that can generalize across different legal domains (criminal, civil, corporate, etc.) while maintaining accuracy.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Legal AI must adhere to strict ethical guidelines and regulatory requirements regarding confidentiality and accuracy.

5. **Jurisdictional Variations**: Legal systems vary significantly across countries and regions, requiring models to understand these distinctions.

## 3. Product Vision

Leg-R1 will be a specialized legal reasoning model that provides transparent, accurate, and contextually appropriate legal analysis across multiple jurisdictions and practice areas. It will serve as a reliable assistant for legal professionals, enhancing their productivity while maintaining the highest standards of legal reasoning.
